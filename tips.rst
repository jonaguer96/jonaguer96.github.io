Paragraphs
-----------

The paragraph (ref) is the most basic block in a reST document. Paragraphs are simply chunks of text separated by one or more blank lines. 
As in Python, indentation is significant in reST, so all lines of the same paragraph must be left-aligned to the same level of indentation.

Inline markup
-------------

The standard reST inline markup is quite simple:

.. figure:: /images/screenshot_text.png
   :alt: Python 
   :align: center
